                            <br>
                            <li>The most commonly known fact about Mount Vesuvius is that it erupted in 79 AD destroying the city of Pompeii, but did you know that the people of pompeii didnt even know that it was a Volcano</li>
                            <li>Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on mainland Europe and is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world</li>
                            <li>Mount Vesuvius erupted 6 times in the 18th century, 8 times in the 19th century and 3 times in the 20th century, since 1944 there have been no eruptions</li>
                            <li>Had the eruption taken place on any other day, the people of Pompeii might have stood a better chance of escape. Usually the wind blew in a southwesterly direction, which would have blown the column out over the Bay of Naples. But on that fateful day, the wind was blowing in a northwesterly direction â€“ straight over Pompeii.</li>
