            <h3>Purpose of Graphics on this site:</h3>
            <p> Web graphics are used make the images and videos pleasing to they eyes but also not so distracting thast it also takes the veiwers attention away from the central content.

                <dt>Pixels</dt>
                <dd>It is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen.</dd>
                <dt>Resolution</dt>
                <dd>Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels a screen can display within a given area.</dd>
                <dt>Lossy Compression</dt>
                <dd>A way to make a file smaller that loses data that is compressed.</dd>
                <dt>Lossless Compression</dt>
                <dd>A way to make a file smaller that does not lose data that is compressed.</dd>
                <dt>JPEG</dt>
                <dd>A JPEG is an acronym for Joint Photographic Expert Groups and it is a 24 bit image format. It can hold 16.8 milion colors. JPEG uses lossy compression so when compressed you lose file data to make it smaller.</dd>
                <dt>PNG</dt>
                <dd>A PNG is an acronym for Portable Network Graphics and it has both an 8 bit and a 24 bit image format named PNG-8 and PNG-24. It supports lossless compressiong so that data isnt lost when compressed however this leads to a much larger file size so it should only be used when qua;ity of an image is what matters. It has better transperancy than GIF and supports image brightness, color correction, and 2 dimentional interlacing. PNG's cannot be animated and not all web site support them. </dd>
                <dt>SVG</dt>
                <dd>A SVG is an acronym for Scalable Vector Graphics and are very scalable. They are written in XML-Based Markup which is like HTML. They can be modified using CSS and JavaScript, and can be animated. For non-complex images SVG isnt the best choice because the size of the file is based of how complex the image is not how large it is.</dd>
                <dt>GIF</dt>
                <dd>A GIF is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. It only supports 256 colors so it isnt the best options for images with a lot of color density. It supports lossless compression so data isnt lost when compressing the file. For many years it was the only image format that supported transparency. </dd>
